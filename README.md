####The Sexy Driver####
*An app that measures your driving habits and determines your level of sex appeal because being sustainable is sexy.*

------------------------------------------------------------

Ever followed a driver that kept braking hard? <br>
A driver that sped suddenly? <br>
A driver that sped and cut lanes? <br>
A nasty one that cut in front of you and braked just for spite? <br>

Or... are you that driver? <br>
<br>

The Sexy Driver is an android app to help evaluate driving skills based on braking and acceleration rates. It uses the GPS and accelerometer within smartphones to track and record these rates in order to give helpful (and lighthearted!) feedback to encourage the user to ease up on that brake or that gas. Using data provided by Canada's Open Government Open Data, the app also gives approximate fuel consumption and CO2 emissions to give that extra prompt to curb those bad driving tendencies.

The underlying goal of the app is to reduce CO2 emissions and encourage safe driving, even if marginally. 

==================================================================

This app was developed in Java using Android Studio within 36 hours during the March 2015 nwHacks. <br>
The theme of the hackathon was Sustainability.
